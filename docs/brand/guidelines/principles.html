    {% header h2 | Goals %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">Stacks is built with a unified goal: We should be writing <em>as little CSS as possible</em>. To achieve this goal, the Stacks team has created a robust set of reusable components. These include components like buttons, tables, and form elements.</p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">We’ve also created a powerful set of atomic classes that can be chained together to create just about <em>any</em> layout without writing a single line of <em>new</em> CSS. Further, these atomic classes can be used as modifiers of pre-existing components.</p>
