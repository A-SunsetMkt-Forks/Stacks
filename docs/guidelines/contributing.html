    <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-title">How does all this work?</h2>
    <p class="stacks-p _section">Stacksâ€™ documentation site, found in the <a class="stacks-code" href="https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/tree/master/docs">/docs/</a> directory, is built using Jekyll. Stacksâ€™ build, found in the <a class="stacks-code" href="https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/tree/master/lib">/lib/</a> directory, is managed by Grunt. The source repo is maintained at <a class="stacks-code" href="https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/">Design/Stacks</a> on Stack Overflowâ€™s GitHub Enterprise instance. Once changes are committed, approved, and merged into <code class="stacks-code">master</code> on GitHub Enterprise, the changes are automatically published at <a href="https://stackoverflow.design">https://stackoverflow.design</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-title">Issues and pull requests are welcome!</h2>
    <p class="stacks-p _section">Reporting issues is super valuable for the Stacks team. If our documentation is inaccurate, please <a href="https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/issues/new">file an issue</a> and let us know as soon as youâ€™re able. Weâ€™ll get it fixed right away! If youâ€™d like to contribute code, youâ€™ll need to be able to run Stacks locally.</p>

    <h2 class="grid jc-spacebetween ai-center stacks-title">Running Stacks locally</h2>
    <p class="stacks-p _section">Ok, so you want to contribute code to Stacks. Or maybe you just want to view some in-progress work locally.</p>

    <p class="stacks-p _section">Youâ€™ll need to install a few dependencies on your Mac first.</p>

    <ol class="stacks-list _section">
        <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>. Our documentation site uses a static site generator called Jekyll to build all its pages. Youâ€™ll need it and all its dependencies. To install, <a href="https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/install-jekyll-on-os-x/">follow this guide</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a>. Our build task uses grunt to do a bunch of things, compile our Less, rebuild our documentation site, and minifies things. Youâ€™ll need it and all its dependencies. To install Grunt, you'll first need to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node & NPM</a>. Once both are installed, open the <code class="stacks-code">Design/Stacks</code> directory in your Terminal. Then type <code class="stacks-code">npm install</code>. This will download all the dependencies to a directory called <code class="stacks-code">node_modules</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="stacks-p _section">Now, open the <code class="stacks-code">Design/Stacks</code> repo in your Terminal and type <code class="stacks-code">grunt</code>. This will start your Jekyll server and watch for any changes you make. You can now visit the site locally at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/">http://127.0.0.1:4000/</a>.</p>
