    <p class="stacks-p _section">Many utility classes in Stacks are also available in screen-size specific variations. For example, the <code class="stacks-code">.d-none</code> utility can be used on small screen sizes and below using the <code class="stacks-code">.sm:d-none</code> class, on medium screen sizes and below using the <code class="stacks-code">.md:d-none</code> class, and on large screen sizes and below using the <code class="stacks-code">.lg:d-none</code> class.</p>

    <p class="stacks-p _section">This is done using predefined max-width media query breakpoints represented by t-shirt sizes. Any classes you apply at desktop screen sizes are also applied to smaller sizes. A common example would be to apply <code class="stacks-code">.md:d-none</code> to an illustration. This means, “At the medium breakpoint and smaller, apply <code class="stacks-code">d-none</code>.”</p>
