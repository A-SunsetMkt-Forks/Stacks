  <h2 class="grid jc-space-between ai-center stacks-title">Goals</h2>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">Stacks is built with a unified goal: We should be writing <em>as little CSS as possible</em>. To achieve this goal, the Stacks team has created a robust set of reusable components. These include components like buttons, tables, and form elements.</p>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">Weâ€™ve also created a powerful set of atomic classes that can be chained together to create just about <em>any</em> layout without writing a single line of <em>new</em> CSS. Further, these atomic classes can be used as modifiers of pre-existing components.</p>

  <h2 class="grid jc-space-between ai-center stacks-title">How to best use Stacks</h2>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">In order to use Stacks, letâ€™s consider the design youâ€™d like to implement.</p>

  <p class="stacks-p _section fw-bold">My design uses existing components</p>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">Identify if the design youâ€™re implementing uses any existing components. Great, it does? Grab the markup from that componentâ€™s example page and paste that into your view.</p>

  <p class="stacks-p _section fw-bold">My design uses existing components but has some special cases.</p>
  <p class="stacks-p _section"><em>e.g. background colors, border, font sizes</em>. Awesome, copy the componentâ€™s example markup to your view and add a atomic class to override its styling. Practically, this will likely just be adding something like an <a href="{{ "/base/spacing" | relative_url }}"><code class="stacks-code">.mb12</code></a> to a button, or hiding something temporarily with <a href="{{ "/base/display" | relative_url }}"><code class="stacks-code">.d-none</code></a>.</p>

  <p class="stacks-p _section fw-bold">My design uses a new pattern that doesnâ€™t have a component yet.</h3>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">No worries, letâ€™s build your view by assembling some atomic classes. If youâ€™re doing this more than once, you should help us identify a new pattern by <a href="https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/issues/new">requesting a new component</a>.</p>

  <p class="stacks-p _section fw-bold">My design is super special andâ€¦</p>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">Iâ€™m going to write a lot of custom CSS from scratch in its own <code class="stacks-code">.less</code> file that Iâ€™ve included in the bundle. You <em>probably</em> shouldnâ€™t be doing this. With atomic classes, you can build <em>most</em> of what youâ€™re attempting to do without writing a single new line of CSS. The Stacks team would prefer you use these pre-existing classes to build new UI. Every line of CSS you write, the more CSS we have to maintain, the more our users have to download, and the more bytes we have to host.</p>

<section class="stacks-section">
  <h2 class="grid jc-space-between ai-center stacks-title" id="toc-javascript">What about Javascript?</h2>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">At this time Stacks is a pure Less/CSS framework and does not include any Javascript. The Javascript written for our examples is only used to demonstrate the componentâ€™s states. It is not meant to be used in production.</p>
