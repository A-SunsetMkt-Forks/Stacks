title: Stack Overflow accessibility audit
---

Howdy! Thank you for taking the time to help address Stack Overflow’s accessibility needs. We’d like as close to a full audit as possible across all of our lines of business. This includes Stack Overflow, Stack Overflow for Teams, Talent & Jobs, as well as our design system. We’re looking to audit our markup for things like tabbing & screen readers, any missing features, and contrast levels.

Beyond the audit, we think there’s an opportunity for a contractor to help with any potential remediations.

Here are the main views in each category:

## Design system

Much of our product is built with our design system [Stacks](https://stackoverflow.design). We’ll want the following:

*   An audit of our components for their markup accessibility. Are we using the correct aria attributes? Does our tabbing strategy make sense? Is our JavaScript limiting users in any way?
*   An accessibility callout with recommendation to each component’s documentation page. Eg. “When working with our buttons, make sure that you’re only using aria-pressed when the button is a toggle.”
*   A general colors audit making sure we’re hitting at least AA in most cases, though we are tolerant of some deviations there. This should include dark mode. I believe pretty strongly that [SAPC](https://www.myndex.com/APCA/) is a better standard to test contrast levels, so I would love to use that as a standard instead of [WCAG](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).
*   Help finding a group of users for user testing of our upcoming “High contrast” [theme](https://deploy-preview-556--stacks.netlify.app) that’s currently being [built](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks/pull/556).
*   General documentation about our stance on accessibility, much like our [Content Guidelines](https://stackoverflow.design/content/) to help guide any future accessibility efforts.
