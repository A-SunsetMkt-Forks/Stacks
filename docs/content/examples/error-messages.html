title: Error messages
description: Things don’t always run smoothly. Our systems can fail. And sometimes we’re to blame. So it’s important we craft clear, logical, and accessible error messages that help folks get stuff done.

    {% header h2 | Understand the error %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Before writing anything, make sure you know the answers to these questions:
    </p>
    <ul class="stacks-list">
        <li>What happened?</li>
        <li>How did it happen?</li>
        <li>How can it be fixed?</li>
        <li>Is it a user or system error, or both?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        How can we expect a user to know what’s going on and how to fix something if <em>we</em> don’t?
    </p>
</section>
<section class="stacks-section">
    {% header h2 | Set a basic structure %}
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        A good error message structure explains what happened and what can be done about it. A message might go something like this:
    </p>
    <div class="grid ai-center p16 bg-black-025 bls-solid blw3 bc-green-2 brr-md wmx6 mb24">
        <div class="grid--cell fc-green-500 pr16">
            {% icon Checkmark | mtn1 mbn1 %}
        </div>
        <div class="fs-body3">
            [The error] [How to fix it]
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        It’s as simple as that. Here’s an example of an inline form error message:
    </p>
    <div class="grid ai-center p16 bg-black-025 bls-solid blw3 bc-green-2 brr-md wmx6 mb24">
        <div class="grid--cell fc-green-500 pr16">
            {% icon Checkmark | mtn1 mbn1 %}
        </div>
        <div class="fs-body3">
            This file is broken. Try picking another.
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        If we can’t place the specific error, we’re deliberately vague. The best we can do is tell the user how they might fix it.
    </p>
    <div class="grid ai-center p16 bg-black-025 bls-solid blw3 bc-green-2 brr-md wmx6">
        <div class="grid--cell fc-green-500 pr16">

        Apologize when it’s the system’s fault and let the user know it’s not their fault. Use <a href="{{ "/content/guidelines/principles#use-active-voice" | relative_url }}">an active voice</a> to accept responsibility. For example:

        Sometimes it’s the user’s fault, but there are ways to tell them without sounding like we’re pointing the finger. For example, we can focus on the desired action rather than telling the user they’ve messed up:

    <p class="stacks-copy">
        <a href="{{ "/content/guidelines/voice-and-tone#tone" | relative_url }}">Tone is how you say something</a>. A message’s tone should depend on how serious the error is. Warmth is great for less serious errors, but avoid anything too lighthearted for serious errors.

        A <strong>non-serious</strong> message reads:

        Avoid mechanical language and jargon, opting for plain language at all times. The aim is to make a user feel like you’re there, helping them solve the error. At the same time, error messages are not the place to be clever or <a href="{{ "/content/guidelines/principles#jokes-&-cultural-references" | relative_url }}">make jokes</a>. This will only muddy your message and add to your user’s frustration.

    {% header h2 | What happens next %}

        Some errors might need a button or link to fix or dismiss the message.
    </p>
    <p class="stacks-copy">
        Always say what happens next. Buttons and links should make sense when read in isolation. Avoid just using things like “Ok”. “Ok” can be used to dismiss a message or take an action. Be clear to the user what they’re saying “Ok” to.
