// Usage of these options is similar to what's described in _stacks-configuration-dynamic.less, but the options
// in this file also apply to the "static" part of Stacks. In particular this means that these options cannot
// be different per-site in the Q&A project, because the static part is a shared CSS file across all Q&A sites.

// OPTIONS
// -------
//
// #stacks-config-static { @css-reset: normalize; }
//
//      `normalize` is the default, which will include normalize.css (the Nicolas Gallagher rest). Other
//      legal options are `meyer` for the Eric Meyer reset, and `none` if no CSS reset should be compiled in.
//


// Previously, the CSS reset option was a simple global variable. For backwards compatibility, we'll handle it correctly for a bit.
@stacks-include-css-reset: this-is-deprecated;

#stacks-config-static {
