# Stacks

Youâ€™re looking at Stack Overflowâ€™s CSS and Design Pattern Library. This library is in its early stages, but will eventually replace Stack Overflowâ€™s CSS as we near our version 1. To see our progress and milestones, check out our [ongoing projects](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/projects).

### Contributing

Stacks is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started). The source files at this repo get mirrored and served from GitHub pages at a [private Repo on GitHub.com](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks/). Once changes are committed, approved, and merged into `master` here, the changes are synced to our [private repo](https://github.com/StackExchange/Stacks/) and automatically rebuilt. The website can be viewed at https://stackoverflow.design

To contribute, clone this repository and create a new branch. Open a pull request with your rationale and the team will review your code. Feel free to open pull requests way earlier than you feel comfortable. :sunglasses:

### Running Stacks

Open this repo in your Terminal and type `grunt`.

This will start your Jekyll server and watch for any changes you make. You can now visit the site locally at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

Youâ€™ve got errors, you likely need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

### Installing Jekyll

To get started with running Jekyll locally, follow the ["Getting Started"](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/SiteStarterPack#getting-started) instructions from the [**Design/SiteStarterPack**](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/SiteStarterPack) repo.

### Installing Grunt

To use Grunt, youâ€™ll first need to install [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Then, install [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/getting-started) globally on your machine. Once both are installed, open this repoâ€™s directory in your Terminal. Within this repoâ€™s folder, type `npm install`. This will download all the dependencies to a directory called `node_modules`. Now you can type `grunt` into the Terminal and itâ€™ll compile the Less, minify CSS, and serve the site locally. ðŸ˜Ž


### Help
If you get stuck, visit [Jekyll's documentation site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
