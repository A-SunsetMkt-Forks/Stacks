# Stacks

You're looking at Stack Overflowâ€™s CSS and Design Pattern Library. This library is in its early stages, but will eventually replace Stack Overflow's CSS as we near our version 1. To see our progress and milestones, check out our [ongoing projects](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/projects).

### Contributing

Stacks is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted internally within Github Enterprise. Once changes are committed or approved and merged into `master`, the site is automatically rebuilt. The website can be viewed at https://stackoverflow.design

To contribute, clone this repository and create a new branch. Open a pull request with your rationale and the team will review your code. Feel free to open pull requests way earlier than you feel comfortable. :sunglasses:

### Installing & previewing locally

To get started with running **Jekyll** locally, follow the ["Getting Started"](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/SiteStarterPack#getting-started) instructions from the [**Design/SiteStarterPack**](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/SiteStarterPack) repo.

Once Jekyll is installed, start Jekyll by typing the following into your Terminal window:

```
jekyll serve
```

This will start your server and watch for any changes. You can now visit the site at http://127.0.0.1:4000/

If you get stuck, visit [Jekyll's documentation site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/). If you still don't find what you're looking for, you can either [create an issue](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/issues/new) or [pop into the **#design-stacks** Slack Channel](https://stackexchange.slack.com/messages/C27RWNQN9/) to ask your question.
