# Stacks

You're looking at Stack Overflowâ€™s CSS and Design Pattern Library. This library is in its early stages, but will eventually replace Stack Overflow's CSS as we near our version 1. To see our progress and milestones, check out our [ongoing projects](https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/projects).

### Contributing

Stacks is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted by GitHub pages. Once your changes are committed to `master`, the site will be rebuilt and hosted at https://gh.stackoverflow.com/pages/Design/Stacks/

To contribute, clone this repository and create a new branch. Open a pull request with your rationale, and the team will review your code and merge it in. Feel free to open pull requests way earlier than you feel comfortable. :sunglasses:

### Installing & previewing locally

To run Stacks locally, open this repo in your Terminal and install Jekyll. To do so, run `gem install jekyll`. This'll install Jekyll and all its dependencies. Once that's installed, you'll want to run Jekyll. Type `jekyll serve`. This will create and serve a local site at http://127.0.0.1:4000/pages/Design/Stacks/. It's an awesome sandbox where you can work on anything without any consequences. Jekyll automatically rebuilds any time it detects a change, though you may still have to refresh your browser window to see them.

If you get stuck, Jekyll has amazing [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
