  <p class="stacks-p _section">Stacks includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with Stack Overflowâ€™s principles, design language, and best practices. Rather than focusing on pixels, developers can focus on application logic, while designers can focus on user experience, interactions, and features.</p>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">Stacks documents a range of resources for designers and developers, which includes:</p>
  <ul class="stacks-list _section">
    <li>Semantic and accessible component markup.</li>
    <li>Cross-browser compatible CSS.</li>
    <li>An icon library.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="stacks-section">
  <h2 class="grid fl-jc-space-between fl-ai-center mb0 stacks-title" id="toc-goals">Goals</h2>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">Stacks is built with a unified goal: We should be writing <em>as little CSS as possible</em>. To achieve this goal, the Stacks team has created a robust set of reusable components. These include components like buttons, tables, and form elements.</p>
  <p class="stacks-p _section">Weâ€™ve also created a powerful set of utility classes that can be chained together to create just about <em>any</em> layout without writing a single line of <em>new</em> CSS. Further, these utility classes can be used as modifiers of pre-existing components.</p>

  <ol class="stacks-list _section">
    <li>Identify if the design youâ€™re implementing uses any existing components. Great, it does? Grab the markup from that componentâ€™s example page and paste that into your view.</li>
    <li>My design uses existing components but has some special cases <em>e.g. background colors, border, font sizes</em>. Rad, copy the componentâ€™s markup to your view and add a utility class to override its styling. Practically, this will likely just be adding something like an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/spacing"><code class="stacks-code">.mb12</code></a> to a button, or hiding something with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/display"><code class="stacks-code">.d-none</code></a>.</li>
    <li>My design uses a new pattern that doesnâ€™t have a component yet. Super rad! Letâ€™s build your view by assembling some utility classes. If youâ€™re doing this more than once, you should help us identify a new pattern by <a href="https://gh.stackoverflow.com/Design/Stacks/issues/new">requesting a new component</a>.</li>
    <li>My design is super special and Iâ€™m going to write a lot of custom CSS from scratch in its own <code class="stacks-code">.less</code> file that Iâ€™ve included in the bundle. You <em>probably</em> shouldnâ€™t be doing this. With utility classes, you can build <em>most</em> of what youâ€™re attempting to do without writing a single new line of CSS. The Stacks team would prefer you use these pre-existing classes to build new UI.</li>
    <li>Right, so Iâ€™m lost. Please drop into <a href="https://stackexchange.slack.com/messages/C27RWNQN9">#design-stacks</a> and weâ€™ll be happy to help you out. ðŸŽˆ</li>
